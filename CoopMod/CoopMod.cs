/* Todo:
 * - Hunter mode is broken: ask jeroen for details
 * - RegionGates only trigger for 1st player
 * 
 * - Provide an in-game (or config file) way of specifying slugcat type, like the below code
 * 
 * - Implement a mechanic that improves the play experience for off-screen slugcats. Multiple options:
 *      1. Use a New Super Mario Bros style teleport, bringing the off-screen player to the same position as the on-screen player
 *      2. Use a picture-in-picture or split screen view to show off-screen slugcat what's happening
 *      Both options have very interesting ramifications.
